# Assault cube trainer
A small trainer made for use in "Assault Cube", perfect for learning about cheat development. This is an ***external*** trainer and is very easy
for beginner game-hackers to understand, I have written this as I think it would help some people along in game hacking development. I personally
went from writing these small trainers to writing big paid cheats in only a few years.

Once you get the hang of it, you will be unstoppable. Follow your own path.
